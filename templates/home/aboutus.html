          <p class="text-small">
            India has a long history of agriculture and farmers have played a vital role in the country's economy and culture. Around 60% of India's population depends on agriculture for their livelihood, making it an essential sector for the country's growth and development.
            Indian farmers grow a diverse range of crops, including rice, wheat, pulses, cotton, sugarcane, fruits, and vegetables.. Many farmers in India are small-scale and depend on their crops for sustenance.
            With the help of this website , We want to reduce their burden of selling their crops at undesirable prices . It will also help the farmers to earn good Incomes and not depending on middleman for any purpose. This website will not only benefit the farmers but also the Consumers who can purchase the products at relatively cheaper prices as compared to the market . This will contribute to the growth of rural India and thus narrowing down the gap between rural and urban areas .
